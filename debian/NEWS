icewm (1.3.8+githubmod+20150213.1+d373d98) experimental; urgency=low

  * This release is based on alternative source, based on a community fork
    maintained on Github.
  * Some left-overs from the long history if IceWM in Debian are removed since
    probably nobody has used them in this decade. This includes Gnome (1) GDM
    integration, additional (actually duplicated) session options in the
    display manager selection, startup script (which emulated deprecated icewm-gnome
    package) and the old icewm-menu-gnome2 menu generation tool (which didn't
    work properly with Debian's stock configuration anyway). For custom menu
    configurations, this may require adaptions of user configuration files,
    see new /etc/X11/icewm/menu file for examples.

icewm (1.2.30-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Noteworthy changes / new features:

  In version 1.2.28, some details of the window focusing behaviour have
  changed. This is due to new assumptions for defaults of aspects that have
  previously not been configurable.

  In this version of IceWM, the configuration options are more fine-grained.
  Please look for instructions in /usr/share/doc/icewm-common/README.Debian.gz
  to adapt your settings if something no longer works as expected.

icewm (1.2.13+CVS20031225-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Noteworthy changes / new features:

  many users are confused with feature improvements and feature
  reordering in the recent versions of IceWM, so here is a short summary
  that may interest you if you run IceWM as stand-alone session program:

  - Most important change: IceWM is no longer monolitic! The
    functionality has been splited out into different helper programs:
    icewm (core window manager), icewmbg (background setter), icewmtray
    (manages the Tray area), icewm-menu-gnome-* (Gnome menu parsers),
    icewm-session (runs them all as needed and controls icewm's execution)
    You need to run icewm-session (or -lite/-experimental flavors) instead of
    icewm in order to get all the functions known from previous versions at
    once
  - IceWM got Docklet support known from KDE. Applications like PSI
    and Gaim may put an active Docklet icon into the Tray area
  - IceWM got FreeType spport which results in nicely rendered fonts and
    throughout UTF-8 support. Unfortunately, it also became touchy to
    incorrect locale settings
  - More image formats are supported by icewmbg now
  - Lots of minor improvements like Xinerama support and nested theme menu
