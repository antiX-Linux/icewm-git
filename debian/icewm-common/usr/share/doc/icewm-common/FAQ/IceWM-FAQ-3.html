<H2><A NAME="s3">3.</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc3">Installation</A></H2>

<P>Now you have the IceWM source package at hand and will want to
install it. So the next question will be:</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc3.1">How to install IceWM from RPM</A>
</H2>

<P>The IceWM developers provide RPM packages for all new releases independently
from the distributions which use this package format. IceWM's RPM
distribution is split into several files. You need icewm-x.y.z-v.rpm.
Optionaly you can download others like icewm-themes, icewm-l10n and
icewm-menu-gnome.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc3.2">How to compile and install IceWM from source?</A>
</H2>

<P>IceWM (0.9.3x and up) uses the standard
GNU autoconf tool, so installation of IceWM is much the same as the
installation of any other package that uses this tool.</P>
<P>First you <B>untar</B> the package using</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    tar xzf icewm-1.2.x.tar.gz
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>then you <B>change</B> to the created <B>directory</B> using</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    cd icewm-1.2.x
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>IceWM comes with a configure script that can be supplied with several
compile-time options. To see them listed use</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    ./configure --help
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Some important options are</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>--prefix</B><DD>
<P>directory under which IceWM files are to be installed</P>
<DT><B>--with-xpm</B><DD>
<P>use the standard X pixmap package to render graphics</P>
<DT><B>--with-imlib</B><DD>
<P>use the more powerful imlib package to render images</P>
<DT><B>--with-gnome-menus</B><DD>
<P>automatically add the GNOME menus to the IceWM
<CODE>start</CODE> menu</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>After you have decided which (if any) options you want to set,
<B>run</B> the <CODE>configure</CODE> script:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    ./configure [option ...]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Assuming that the configure script exited successfully, you should
then <B>compile</B> IceWM using</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    make
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>which will build IceWM with the options specified by the configure
script. If everything compiles successfully, you can now
<B>install</B> IceWM on your machine by entering</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> To do so you will typically need to become
<B>root</B> (at least if you didn't supply an install directory you
as a user have write access to - this you can change in Makefile).</P>
<P>Now you have an IceWM binary sitting on your disk. Is that what you
really want? Obviously not, you want to <EM>run</EM> IceWM. The next
section describes how to set up IceWM as your default window manager.</P>


<H2><A NAME="defwm"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc3.3">How to make IceWM my default window manager?</A>
</H2>

<P>In order to run IceWM, you must <B>assure</B> that the
<B>executable</B> (called <CODE>icewm</CODE>) <B>is
in</B> your <B>path.</B> You should then <B>add IceWM to</B>
your <B>X start-up script</B> (which could be
<CODE>.xinitrc</CODE>, <CODE>.xsession</CODE> or
<CODE>.Xclients</CODE>).</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> Supplying the full path to IceWM isn't sufficient - if
IceWM isn't in your path, restarting it will fail (even if you don't do
this by hand it is done automatically on changing the theme).</P>
<P>Which of the scripts mentioned above is the right one mainly depends
on whether you manually start X (using <CODE>startx</CODE>)
or have X running all the time.</P>
<P>First I explain what you need to do if you manually start X. Then I
address the case &#34;X is running all the time&#34; (which means
that you log in via <CODE>xdm</CODE> or something like that).
Finally I describe what both cases have in common.</P>

<H3>Running IceWM at X startup</H3>

<P>If you use <CODE>startx</CODE> to start up X then you run
your window manager from the <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> file.</P>

<H3>Running IceWM after graphical login</H3>

<P>If your system has a graphical login (X is already running while you
log in) you are using a display manager such as
<CODE>xdm</CODE>, <CODE>kdm</CODE> or
<CODE>gdm</CODE>. In this case <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE>
has no effect (it is not read in by <CODE>xdm</CODE>). You
must instead use a <CODE>.xsession</CODE> file.</P>
<P><B>Hint:</B> It is absolutely no problem to have a
<CODE>.xsession</CODE> and a <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE>
file (which is especially useful for inhomogeneous networks).</P>
<P>Mandrake users repeatedly reported that their <CODE>.xsession</CODE> wasn't read
and no applications started. To work around that in the <CODE>kdm</CODE> login
interface choose <CODE>Default</CODE> and add IceWM as the last
entry to your <CODE>.xsession</CODE>.</P>

<H3>Besides the differences</H3>

<P>You might have noticed that - besides being  used in different
cases - <CODE>.xsession</CODE> and
<CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> are essentially the same. On some
systems they are in fact the very same file which is called
<CODE>.Xclients</CODE> with <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> and
<CODE>.xsession</CODE> both being symbolic links to this
file.</P>
<P>Irrespective which start script you use (<CODE>.xsession</CODE>,
<CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> or <CODE>.Xclients</CODE>) it must
be executable. This may be achieved by issuing the following command:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    chmod u+x ~/.filename
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>A minimalist's start-up file consists of only the command to start
the window manager (in our case <CODE>icewm</CODE>). Most geeky people
add other stuff to the file to make it look more complicated and
confuse beginners &gt;;-&gt;</P>
<P>Though that may be the reason for some of us, the greater majority
add commands to customize X and to start some programs on login
(typical example: an <CODE>xterm</CODE>)</P>
<P>The following is a (reasonable) <CODE>.xinitrc</CODE> file
used as an example by Marko:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    #-----------------------------------------------------------
    # .xinitrc
    #-----------------------------------------------------------

    # run profile to set $PATH and other env vars correctly
    . $HOME/.bash_profile

    # setup background
    xsetroot -solid '#056'

    # setup mouse acceleration
    xset m 7 2

    # run initial programs
    xterm &amp;

    # start icewm, and run xterm if it crashes (just to be safe)
    exec icewm || exec xterm -fg red

    #-----------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P><B>Note:</B> To run IceWM, the <CODE>icewm</CODE> command
needs to be executed. This means that all programs that are run
before starting <CODE>icewm</CODE> either have to terminate
immediately or to run in background. Also, don't
<CODE>exec</CODE> them because that terminates execution of
<CODE>.xinitrc.</CODE></P>

<H3><A NAME="icewmsess"></A> IceWM > 1.2.13</H3>

<P>Beginning with IceWM 1.2.13 there is a binary <CODE>icewm-session</CODE>.
This binary helps you to handle all IceWM subparts (icewmbg, icewm, icewmtray, startup, shutdown started in this order).
Therefore you can use <CODE>icewm-session</CODE> to start IceWM.
<CODE>icewm</CODE> now starts only window manager itself.</P>

<P>If you want to start only some parts of the IceWM, then you can add them to 
your <CODE>.xsession</CODE> or similar file before <CODE>exec icewm</CODE>, otherwise it is 
enough to use only <CODE>exec icewm-session</CODE>.</P>
