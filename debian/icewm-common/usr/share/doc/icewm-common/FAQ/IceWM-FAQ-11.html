<P>This section is a collection of tools that simplify the usage of
IceWM. Head on over to the utilities section of the IceWM homepage if you
want an up to date overview about all available tools.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc11.1">IcePref</A>
</H2>

<P><B>Note:</B> IcePref is a history these day, but you can still find it.</P>

<H3>Description (by the author of IcePref)</H3>

<P>IcePref is a small graphical utility (written with Python and the Gtk
toolkit) designed to simplify the configuration of IceWM.</P>
<P>It currently supports the options of IceWM version 1.0.4 and should
(in theory) work consistently with versions at least as high as
1.0.4. While it is not a particularly elegant program, I have found
IcePref useful and hope that it will be found useful by those who use
IceWM and also have Gtk installed.</P>
<P>IcePref should be especially useful to those who have GNOME, and who
are therefore likely to have PyGNOME and PyGTK already installed on
their boxes.</P>

<H3>Download IcePref</H3>

<P>IcePref was available from

<H2><A NAME="ss11.4">11.4</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc11.4">IceWM Control Panel</A>
</H2>

<H3>Description (by author of IceWM Control Panel)</H3>

<P>IceWM Control Panel is the first full-featured, Gtk-based control panel 
for IceWM. It is meant to run in IceWM, but can be used in ANY window 
manager as a general-purpose control panel. It was inspired by the Qt-based 
application called IceMC, but includes many more tools, a more familiar 
Windoze Control Panel-like interface, and uses the MUCH faster Gtk user 
interface (Who runs a fast Window Manager like IceWM, to launch SLOW-running, 
memory-intensive Qt/KDE-based applications?? I sure don't). 
Let's face it: IceWM and fast Gtk interfaces work well together. </P>
<P>IceWM Control Panel includes applications for editing preferences (IcePref2),
menus (IceMe), themes, sounds (IceSoundMngr), cursors, keys, mouse, wallpapers,
winoptions, icon browser etc.</P>

software for IceWM, include: menu/toolbar editor, Ice Sound Configurator, 
theme Switcher, backgroundoptions editor, IceWM's winoptions editor, keys 
editor.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.6">11.6</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc11.6">IceWMConf</A>
</H2>

<H3>Description (by the author of IceWMConf)</H3>

<P>IceWMConf is a small application which helps with configuring IceWM.
It tries to be self-configuring, starting with the basic options from
the system preferences files and then overriding them with user
preferences.</P>
<P>In this way, it should pick up new options introduced by later
versions of IceWM. (It does mean that old options aren't deleted, so
you have to occasionally &#34;trim&#34; your user file to remove
lines IceWM grumbles about, but that isn't very necessary.)</P>
<P>Its user interface is functional bordering on spartan, but builds its
own option categories and has an option name search facility. If you
want a really user friendly configuration tool, I suggest IcePref.</P>

</H2>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P>MenuMaker is utility written entirely in Python that scans through the system for 
installed programs and generates menu for specified X window manager. 
It is by far more superior to existing solutions in terms of knowledge base size, 
maintainability and extensibility, and has a number of features that have no counterparts 
in its class. MenuMaker is intended for users of lightweight *NIX graphical desktop environments.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.10">11.10</A> <A HREF="IceWM-FAQ.html#toc11.10">IDesk</A>
</H2>

<H3>Description</H3>

<P>iDesk gives users of minimal wm's (fluxbox, pekwm, windowmaker...) icons on 
their desktop. The icon graphics are either from a png or svg (vector) file 
and support some eyecandy effects like transparency. Each icon can be confgured
to run one or more shell commands and the actions which run those commands are 
completely configurable. In a nutshell if you want icons on your desktop and 
you don't have or dont't want KDE or gnome doing it, you can use idesk.</P>
